	- This can be used to run code, store date, host websites or anything a cloud could do. It is hosted remotely by Amazon or AWS and it paid for.

2. Create a subnet
	- This is a peice of a larger network and can be used to divide large networks into smaller ones. We helped our vpc by setting the traffic so it can travel a shorted distance.

3. Create an internet gateway
	- This can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the internet. We used it to provice a target in our VPC route tables for internet traffic.

4. Create a route table
	- This is used to keep track of paths and determine which way to forward traffic. We used it exactly for this in our VPC to control where traffic goes.

5. Create a security group
	- This is basically a virtual firewall for incomming and outgoing traffic. We used it to setup inbound rules for our VPC.
