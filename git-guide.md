- status
	- Shows status of the local repository. This status includes:
		- number of local commits that have not been synced with remote (GitHub)
		- list of files in local folder than are NOT being tracked by git
		- list of files in local folder that have changes that need to be committed
	- EX: git status
- clone
	- is used to clone points to an existing repo and makes a clone or copy of the repo in a new directory, at another location
	- EX: git clone <repo> <directory> 
- add
	- adds a change in the working directory to the staging area
		-  it tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit
	- EX: git add <what you want to add>
- rm
	- removes individual files or a collection of files
		- the primary function of git rm is to remove tracked files from the git index and will delete teh file entirely
		- git rm --cached will only remove from the index so you can keep the file but not be tracked
	- git rm <file>
- commit
	- captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes
		- committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to
	- git commit -am "comment on what change you made during the commit here"
- push
	- uploads local repository content to a remote repository
		- pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo
	- git push
- fetch
	- downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo
		- fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on
	- git fetch <remote>
- merge
	- lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
	- git merge <branch>
- pull
	- used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content
		- the git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge
	- git pull
- branch
	- lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches
		- it doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again
	- git branch <branch>
- checkout
	- lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch
		- checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to			 record all new commits on that branch
	- git checkout <branch name>
- .git folder
	- contains all the information that is necessary for your project in version control and all the information about commits, remote repository address, etc
- .gitignore file
	- allows you to add files to tell get you no longer want to show being tracked
- Pull requests
	- lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub
		- you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch
- SSH authentication to repositories
	- this is the service used to access private git repositories more securley using ssh
